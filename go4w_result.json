Raymond mill is the vertical grinding mill, which is popular in many countries and has very long history. HGM ultrafine grinding mill is special for super thin grinding. You can choose suitable gravel grinding mill depends on your gravel size, hardness, capacity and your cost budget.\r\nGravel ultrafine grinding line:\r\n  Clirik has the best gravel ultrafine grinding line. Under the same finished final size and the same motor power, the capacity of micro powder grinding mill is twice as much as jet mill, mixing grinder and ball mill.

If you want to reduce the cost of production you can choose our gravel ultrafine grinding mill.\r\nRaw gravel first enters jaw crusher to be crushed to smaller size. They are lift to storage room by elevator. Vibrating feeder will feed materials into grinding chamber evenly and gradually. After being grinded, the quartz powder will be blow to cyclone by blower. Then the gravel powder will be transferred to storage room through pipes, and then will be discharged as final products.\r\n The Application of gravel ultrafine powder grinding mill:\r\nHGM series gravel ultrafine powder grinding mill is mainly applied to non-inflammable, non-explosive and brittle materials with Moh  hardness under six. Such as calcite, chalk, gravel, dolomite, kaolin, gypsum, etc, totally more than 100 kinds of materials.

After crushed by hammer crusher, the big materials become small ones and are sent to storage hopper by elevator and further sent to the middle of first dial evenly by the electromagnetic vibrating feeder and feeding pipe. The materials will be driven to the edge of dial by centrifugal force and fall down into the ring, crushed and grinded by roller, and become powder after production of three rings. The high pressure centrifugal blower will inhale air from outside and blow the crushed materials to classifier. The rotating turbo in the powder concentrator will make the coarse powder materials return to the mill and reground, while the fineness will mix with the air and go into the cyclone and be discharged in the discharge bin, which is at the bottom of it.

For same material and final size, the lifetime of its wearing parts can reach to more than one year, about 2-5 times as long as that of vertical shaft impact crusher and turbo-mill. Especially when handling calcium carbonate and calcite, the lifetime can reach 2-5 years.\r\n3.
