Silage can be covered much faster and the process is less expensive than with conventional silage films.Because the polyamide underlay film is attached to the silage film, this kind of silage film can be applied in a single step. The adhesive underlay film allows for the diffusion of moisture, yet also forms a significantly improved oxygen barrier. The underlay automatically separates from the silage film after a time, adhering to the surface of the silage during fermentation.Using one film instead of two saves on transport, warehousing and labour. There are also environmental savings over conventional films: 40% less raw material used during manufacture and 50% less packaging. The product has been field-tested and positively received by farmers.2 In 1 Option4 mil Silage Sheeting & 1 mil Barrier Film in a single rollUnroll and Unfold both films in one fast and easy operation4 mil holds down the 1mil Barrier Film during installation", "ProductImageSrc": ""}, {"productName": "High Strength Black/White Silage Covering", "productText": "Silage covering is used in silage protection.
